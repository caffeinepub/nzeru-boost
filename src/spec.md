# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Apply Malawi flag color theme (black, red, green) throughout the application and fix remaining install button text to say "Bongo Feed".

**Planned changes:**
- Update install button text from "Nzeru Boost" to "Bongo Feed"
- Apply black as primary background color throughout the app
- Apply red (#CE1126) for buttons and accent elements
- Apply green (#339E35) for secondary elements
- Update CSS custom properties in frontend/index.css and frontend/src/index.css to use Malawi flag colors
- Update Tailwind configuration to support the new color scheme
- Ensure consistent color application across all pages and components

**User-visible outcome:** The application displays "Bongo Feed" consistently on all buttons and uses the Malawi flag color scheme (black background, red accents/buttons, green secondary elements) throughout the interface.
